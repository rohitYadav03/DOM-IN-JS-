<!-- Event capturing (also called the capture phase) is when an event travels 
 from the root (window or document) down to the target element in the DOM tree. -->


 <!-- element.addEventListener('eventType', eventHandler, true); -->

 Visualizing Capturing
If the DOM is structured as:

Window -> Document -> HTML -> Body -> Parent -> Child

When you click on Child, capturing order:
Window
Document
HTML
Body
Parent
Child

stopPropagation():
<!-- What it does: Stops the event from propagating (bubbling or capturing).
  This means the event will not be passed on to the parent elements. -->


  preventDefault():
<!-- What it does: Prevents the default action associated with the event.
For example, if you click a link, the default action is to navigate to the linkâ€™s URL. Using preventDefault() will stop that behavior. -->
